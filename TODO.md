# TODOs (after the OSDI deadline)

- Merge various forks created for individual apps
- Consolidate setup scripts for each app to be machine-agnostic (to run on a different setup easily)
- Fix Eden/Shenango bug in Memcached write path
- Decouple fault tracing tool from Eden/Shenango so it could be used widely
