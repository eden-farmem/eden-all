All application & other benchmarks for Eden and related systems

#
# TODOs (after the OSDI deadline)
#

- Merge various forks created for individual apps
- Consolidate setup scripts for each app to be machine-agnostic (to run on a different setup easily)
- Fix Eden/Shenango bug in Memcached write path
- Decouple fault tracing tool from Eden/Shenango so it could be used widely
- Reproduce results on memcached without no-dirty changes for the rebuttal
- Add/test malloc interposition in Shenango shim
